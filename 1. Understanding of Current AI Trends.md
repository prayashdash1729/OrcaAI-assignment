One significant AI development in the past year is the advancement of generative AI models for text-to-image and text-to-video generation. These models, like OpenAI's SORA, DALL-E and Google's most recent model Veo, can create high-quality visuals and videos from simple text descriptions. While these models were present for some time, recently in the past couple of years, the sheer magnitude of improvement in producing absolutely realistic, cinematic and detailed images and videos has been remarkable. This advancement has opened up new possibilities in various industries, including media and entertainment, education, and marketing.

### Impact
Media and Entertainment: Almost every kind of visual content generation has become a piece of cake for everyone. Filmmakers and game developers can quickly generate visuals and storyboards, speeding up production. You sont need a team of editors and designers to create a visual representation of your ideas. You can now simply descibe your frame and get a high quality image or a whole video based on the plot or theme.
Education: Interactive and engaging learning materials can be created, making education more immersive.
Marketing: Customized advertisements tailored to specific audiences can increase engagement and conversion rates.

### Personal experience
I am the Joint Secretary of the Astronomy Club in my college. We have been using various AI tools to generate images and animated videos for posters, magazines and instagram posts. This has greatly helped in making things and generating new ideas in a very tight schedule. We have been able to create high quality content in a very short time. This has also helped in increasing the engagement of the club members since they now spend less time on designing and more time on the actual content and work.
